# adfExplorer

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Kickstart1_3.png" alt="Kickstart V1.3 splash screen" align="right" />

Read and mutate virtual Commodore Amiga Disks, stored as files (a.k.a Amiga Disk Files).

## Installation

> Get CRAN version
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("adfExplorer")
```

> Get development version from R-Universe
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("adfExplorer", repos = c("https://pepijn-devries.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```
## Usage

The package comes with an example disk for which files and directories can be listed:

```{r init}
library(adfExplorer)
data("adf.example")

list.adf.files(adf.example)
```

You can also pull files from the virtual disk:

```{r get_file}
## get startup-sequence file and store as a vector of raw data
startup <- get.adf.file(adf.example, "DF0:s/startup-sequence")

## As this particular file is UTF8 text we can convert it from raw:
startup  |> rawToChar() |> iconv(from = "ISO-8859-1", to = "UTF-8") |> cat()
```

For more in depth examples see `vignette("amigaDiskFiles")`.

## Developmental status

It has been years since the initial release of this package. Since its release a lot has changed in R and in
my skill set. I still have plans for this package, but this requires drastic changes. Therefore, I will only
apply minimal maintenance to this package. Meanwhile I will work on a complete overhaul which will be released
in due time as a new package. This new package will:

 * have the same or similar features as the current package.
 * will implement modern R features and try to adhere to tidyverse principles.
 * implement recursive procedures in C/C++ giving the package a speed boost.

But until then, please enjoy the current package as is.
