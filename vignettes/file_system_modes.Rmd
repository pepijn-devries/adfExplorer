## Fast File System vs. Old File System

With Amiga OS version 2.0, the so-called Fast File System (FFS) was introduced.
The previous file system was not named at the time, but is now commonly
referred to as the Old File System (OFS). The OFS sacrifices disk space
for validation purposes, making it more robust in case of data recovery when
a disk got damaged. This advantage was dropped with the FFS making it
slightly faster (on original machines) and gaining disk space for file
data. The FFS does not have backward compatability. So disks formatted with
this file systems cannot be read by Amiga OS versions <2.0.

## International mode

In OS version 2.0 the 'international mode' was also introduced. This mode was
meant to correct for a mistake in the routine to convert text into upper case.
On the Amiga file names can have both lower and upper case characters. But
during file name matching, the case is ignored. For that purpose, file names
are shifted to upper case in file name matching routines.

The Amiga uses the ISO 8859 Latin-1 character set, where in older
operating systems (<2.0), international characters (e.g., '&oslash;')
were not capitalised. This mistake was corrected in OS 2.0, but is
optional. In combination with the 'directory cache mode' (see below),
the international mode is mandatory.

## Directory Caching

With Amiga OS 3.0, the 'directory cache mode' was
introduced. With the directory cache mode, one or more blocks are stored
for each directory (including the root) with basic information about
the files stored in that directory. In older versions, the directory
header only stored pointers to the files in that directory.
This meant that in older OS versions the header of each file (all scattered
around the disk) needed to be
loaded, in order to list all files in that directory.
As with the directory cache mode
all information was stored in one block (or more when necessary), it
was faster at listing directory content. On the original machine that
is, as floppy disk drives were pretty slow.

Note that using the 'directory cache' mode requires a larger storage
overhead for the file system, leaving less capacity for actual file data.

## Creating disks with diferent modes

When you create a blank disk with `create_adf_device()`, it contains no data at all.
In order to store files on the virtual disk, you need to format it with a file
system. This can be achieved with `prepare_adf_device()`. With this function
you can also specify which of the modes listed above you want to use for that disk:

```{r setup}
library(adfExplorer, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

disk_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".adf")

## Create a blank device and create a connection to it:
new_device <- create_adf_device(disk_file, write_protected = FALSE)

## Format the device and install a file system:
prepare_adf_device(
  dev           = new_device,
  name          = "Example_disk",
  ffs           = TRUE,  ## Use fast file system
  international = TRUE,  ## Use international mode
  dircache      = FALSE) ## Don't use directory caching.

## Don't forget to close the connection when you are done:
close(new_device)
```
