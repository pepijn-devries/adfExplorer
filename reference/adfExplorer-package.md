# adfExplorer: Access and Manipulate Amiga Disk Files

Amiga Disk Files (ADF) are virtual representations of 3.5 inch floppy
disks for the Commodore Amiga. Most disk drives from other systems
(including modern drives) are not able to read these disks. The
'adfExplorer' package enables you to establish R connections to files on
such virtual DOS-formatted disks, which can be use to read from and
write to those files.
